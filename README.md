# tic-tac-toe

A tic-tac-toe game, written in Ruby using Gosu.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/subdigital/tic-tac-toe/master/tic-tac-toe.gif)

## Running the game

It requires [gosu](https://www.libgosu.org) and [Hasu]()https://github.com/michaelfairley/hasu to run. To install them:

```
gem install gosu
gem install hasu
```

Once the gems are installed, just run it with ruby:

```
ruby game.rb
```

## Live Reload

Hasu supports live reload, so you can keep the game running and just make edits, all while not changing the entirety of game state, which can be useful for tweaking.


## Gameplay

Use the mouse and select a square. Then give the mouse to a friend. 3 in a row wins.

## Why?

I've been interested in game development ever since I started programming. I've never shipped a real game. So I listed a bunch of simple games I could create quicly and just got started.
This is the first one.

I wrote [pong](https://github.com/subdigital/pong) already, this seemed like a good next step.

## The Code Sucks! What gives?

The point is to finish something, ship it and move on. Pull requests accepted! Maybe I'll learn a few things ;)

## What's Next?

Probably Breakout.
