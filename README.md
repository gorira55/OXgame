# tic-tac-toe

A tic-tac-toe game, written in Ruby using Gosu.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/subdigital/tic-tac-toe/master/tic-tac-toe.gif)

## Running the game

It requires [gosu](https://www.libgosu.org) to run. To install gosu:

```
gem install gosu
```

Once gosu is installed, just run it with ruby:

```
ruby game.rb
```

## Gameplay

Use the mouse and select a square. Then give the mouse to a friend. 3 in a row wins.

## Why?

I've been interested in game development ever since I started programming. I've never shipped a real game. So I listed a bunch of simple games I could create quicly and just got started.
This is the first one.

I wrote [pong](https://github.com/subdigital/pong) already, this seemed like a good next step.

## The Code Sucks! What gives?

The point is to finish something, ship it and move on. Pull requests accepted! Maybe I'll learn a few things ;)

## What's Next?

Probably Breakout.
